# Data_Visualization
Every death and serious injury on the road is a preventable tragedy and yet, on
average, in the last decade five people have died every day on the road in the UK and 84 were
seriously injured

Through this project, our goal is to visualize the data regarding accidents to
understand what are the general characteristics of these occurrences, focusing primarly on the
role of age, gender and means of transportation. Our meta-objective is configured, instead, to
try to raise awareness of this issue, try to understand how important it is to take into account a
number of factors to avoid, as much as possible, these unfortunate events.
